Your grid is laid out in a 4x4 grid, rows A-D & columns 1-4

You will place a 2 cell ship and 3 cell ship

Ships cannot wrap around the board
Ships cannot overlap
Ships can be laid either horizontally or vertically

Coordinates must correspond to the first and last units of the ship. 
(IE: You can’t place a two unit ship at “A1 A3”)

Once ships are laid out, you and the enemy will trade shots until the
last enemy ship is sunk. When you make a shot, a message will display
indicating a hit or miss, and if you've sunk a ship. 

After each shot the respective player's grid will be shown, until the
last enemy ship is sank. Now go enjoy the game!
